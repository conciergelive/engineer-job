# Concierge Live - Senior Engineering Job

We're looking for someone who is smart, curious, and loves building web apps. A full stack engineer that enjoys all aspects of web development and has experience managing and deploying software.

## What we do?

Concierge Live is a forward thinking technology company in a space where technology is lagging: the ticket industry. We offer software to help companies better manage their events and tickets. Like a private company box office. We allow companies to manage tickets they've already purchased and purchase tickets if they have not.

We are a growing entity of [Prime Sport](www.primesport.com), a highly profitable company in the ticketing industry with over 100 official partnerships, including the NCAA and the NFL.

## Our stack

Ruby 2.1, Rails, Coffee Script, PostgreSQL, all deployed on Heroku. Our team has very strong OO principles and a well tested code base, you won't be jumping into a messy app.

## What we're looking for

* Experience building web apps. The more the merrier. We'll be most interested in checking out what you have built.
* Passionate about web apps and code: You are opinionated about how software should work, inside and out.
* Expert in ruby (at least 3 years experience)
* Experience managing and deploying B2B software.
* Working remote is acceptable, we also have a fantastic office in Atlanta GA.

## Job Perks

* A competitive base salary and equity stake in a growing entity of an established highly profitable company.
* A monthly budget to spend on tickets to live events
* The opportunity to write code that is used outside of Concierge Live, e.g. we've opensourced a number of our projects including Authlogic, Searchlogic, etc.
* A superb benefits package, including full health/dental/vision
